Currently I am building a web development portfolio, hence the *blog*. "What is your story?" I hear you ask. Well
it goes like this. I completed sixth form with 2 A*s in Maths and Further Maths and an A in Chemistry. I was originally
going to study Chemical Engineering at the University of Bath because I liked the feel of the place after a sunny open day
visit. During sixth form I was in a band called [The Outside](https://www.facebook.com/theoutside4) Here is a picture of us playing a gig at The Wheatsheaf in Oxford.

Thats me on the right playing the bass! After finishing sixth form we decided to take a gap year to be in the band and see if we could make it in the music industry.
The year out was very fun, we played many gigs, wrote lots of songs and released two songs on Spotify. During this time I also worked as a delivery driver at Waitrose and the others worked as teaching assistants
and at Tesco. As it turns out four fresh-faced 18 year olds couldn't make it in the music industry, but we grew a lot as a result of the experience.

During the year out I decided to switch course to Computer Science. I chose this because an older family friend said that if he could 
go back and choose what to study, he would have chosen Computer Science. Also I have always really enjoyed solving problems and I 
wanted to do something more practical. So in October 2017 I began studying Computer Science at the University of
Bath. I was blessed to be put in such a lovely house of kind and interesting people - E48. Here is a picture of when I cooked spaghetti 
bolognese for all 13 of us in the house :)

I took to my course like a duck to water. The course was structured incredibly well. We started with the language C, which is an
old low-level language, we learnt this to teach us what a programming language does - communicate with the operating system to manage and manipulate data.
Learning these concepts early on helps later on when using higher level languages, especially to understand how to make memory and time efficient programs.
We then moved onto Java where we learnt about Object Oriented Programming. The course wasn't all programming though, we also had units about the software 
engineering lifecycle, computer systems architecture and operating systems. I thoroughly enjoyed the course in the first year and worked very hard achieving 86%
overall which placed me in the top 10 students in my year. An achievement I am very proud of, especially as I won a £200 amazon voucher!

But it wasn't all work in my first year. I did a lot in my free time - running, working out, producing music, playing with a band, countless nights out, uni ski trip, jam nights and lots of antics. After finishing my first year, I decided to spend the summer focused on learning to produce music. It was a great summer! The weather was beautiful and I spent lots of time with my friends and outdoors. I released a song once a week for 7 weeks, eventually thinning it down to an EP of my favourite 4 tracks I had made called Summer.

After an enjoyable summer, I returned to Bath for my second year of university. Second year was a lot more work then first year and I struggled to have a 
good balance between university, social life, exercising and hobbies.The second year units covered topics such as artificial intelligence, visual computing, human computer interaction, machine learning, a group project and some fundamental maths modules. For my group based project, I took the lead of a fantastic group and we created "SampleSafe" - a program used to help music producers organise and share samples. I really enjoyed developing an idea into a software system as a team. Another highlight was in AI where we built a program which learnt to play connect 4 optimally through reinforcement learning. We plotted a graph of its win rate % against time spent learning. Whilst I did enjoy my second year, I did not enjoy the strain it put on my life balance. This along with being a perfectionist and some traumatic events from my past which I hadnt dealt with, caused me to develop depression. It was a tough time, but I managed to perservere and complete my second year with a high first. 

After completing my second year I had a few weeks off, including a week long surf trip to Westward Ho! with The Outside. I then started an internship at CiteAb - a life sciences data company - who among other things create a reagant search engine for researchers, which allows users to see the number of citations a specific reageant has. I was working on improving the architecture and efficency of there webscraping processes. I really enjoyed working at a CiteAb, it was brilliant to see how the skills I had learnt at university could be applied to real world problems. Also learning about how the company was created and has developed over time to become a profitable small business was very interesting. Also the team there were lovely people and I enjoyed our meals out, tea break chats and playing table tennis in the office. Unfortunately I got ill after my first month there with what I thought at the time was glandular fever. I went to the doctors and had lots of tests, but I didn't have glandular fever or anything to be causing my symptoms of headache, fatigue, sore throat and difficulty concentrating. This went on to develop into quite a serious health issue for me and as such I had to leave CiteAb after 1 month.

After having the summer off to heal and recuperate, I went back to Bath for my final year. But after 7 weeks in the first term, I got depressed again and couldnt make myself do my course. I had to postpone my year and come back home for a long time. During this time my symptoms of fatigue and headache got much worse and I developed a chronic daily headache which would get much worse after stressful events, event though I wasn't aware that this was triggering me. After lots of tests with the doctors, they found nothing wrong with me and I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. It has been 2 years since this all began and I have spent the last two years working very hard to heal myself. It has been a long journey from trying different medications, therapy, lifestyle changes and lots of health related reading. In the end I believe my condition was psychosomatic, that means its is caused by my mind. Dr. John Sarno is a revolutionary doctor in this area and I read his book about how repressed emotions specifically rage in the subconscious can cause all sorts of chronic pain issues. This was a breakthrough for me and I began a journey of learning about psychosomatic illnesses and how to heal from them. It has been a long and difficult journey, but thankfully I am now at a place where the headaches are affecting my life much less. This is a long story which I may go into in another post. When I retook my final year during this time, I again got ill and was unable to finish my degree, but I was awarded a Diploma of Higher Education for the 2 years I did complete.

During my healing time I became super interested in how the world works - economics, capitalism etc. I have done lots of reading about all of this and now that I understand it better I feel more at peace with the way the world is and with finding my place in it. I became very interested in technology and how it can change the world. I thought of many business ideas and set about learning to create websites. I soon realised how much goes into creating a business and a website. I knew that I would have to gain experience before starting my own business. So now I am building a web development portfolio and looking for a job using javascript. I think eventually I would love to run a web development team, where we create software and businesses for good in the world. Some of my ideas include: 
- A game to teach emotional intelligence 
- An advertisement service which advertises wellbeing activities to you through social media
- Creating communities and organising people to do beneficial activities for themselves and the world 
- Creating services that help create small businesses to help others find there place in society and to create a more decentralised and fair society. 

So far in my web development I have been learning javascript, react, nodejs and nextjs mostly. I have done lots of tutorials and learning. I built an Online Multiplayer Drum Sequencer with a friend of mine it is hosted [here](http://online-drum-sequencer.herokuapp.com/). It allows multiple people to create a drum beat together online at this website, play around with it, its good fun. My github is [here](https://github.com/JackMcBride98) if you want to see some of the things I have been working on. 

Anyway there's a brief introduction to my life for the last few years, its time to get back to creating my portfolio. Here's to the future.
