Currently I am building a web development portfolio, hence the *blog*. "What is your story?" I hear you ask. Well
it goes like this. I completed sixth form with 2 A*s in Maths and Further Maths and an A in Chemistry. I was originally
going to study Chemical Engineering at the University of Bath because I like the feel of the place after a sunny open day
visit. During sixth from I was in a band called [The Outside](https://www.facebook.com/theoutside4)
